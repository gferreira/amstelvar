Amstelvar
=========

fork of the original Amstelvar, with all unnecessary files removed and a few new ones added

we use this repository to:

- build a designspace with `opsz` `wght` `wdth` axes only
- generate instances at avar2 extrema (duovars, trivars, quadravars)
  - `opsz` 8-144
  - `wght` 200-800
  - `wdth` 85-125
- measure the generated instances using `measurements.json`
- save measurements into a `blends.json` file
